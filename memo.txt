~/neuron_mpi/nrn/share/nrn/lib/hoc

if you add some line in the hoc in this directory, and if you execute load_file("nrngui.hoc")(<-example), you can reflect the change that you want to realize.

and you can touch the new hoc file in this directory, and execute load_file("~~~.hoc").
new files can add to this directory without compiling!!
